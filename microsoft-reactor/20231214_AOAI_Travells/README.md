## 1. Creating a Python Flask API to Interact with Azure Open AI

> 1. Python Flask API
> 1. Python Flask Web API Project Structure

### 1.1 Python Flask API

#### Lightweight and Easy to Use

> 1. Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python that is designed to be simple and easy to use. It provides the essentials needed for building web applications without unnecessary complexity. This simplicity makes it an excellent choice for beginners and for projects where a minimalistic approach is preferred.

#### Extensible and Modular

> 1. Flask follows a modular design, allowing developers to use only the components they need. It is extensible, meaning that you can add various extensions to enhance its functionality, such as authentication, database integration, and more. This modular and extensible nature makes Flask flexible and adaptable to different project requirements.

### 1.2. Python Flask Web API Project Structure

> 1. `api_routes.py`: This file contains API routes and handling for adding country information.
> 1. `models.py`: This file defines the SQLAlchemy database model for the CountryInfoDto table.
> 1. `db_config.py`: This file contains the SQLAlchemy database configuration using the db object.
> 1. `env_config.py`: This file handles loading environment variables from the .env file.
> 1. `error_handling.py`: This file contains the utility function for handling error responses.
> 1. `GetCountryInfoFromAzureOpenAI.py`: This file handles integration with Azure OpenAI to fetch country information.
> 1. `logging_config.py`: This file configures logging settings for the Flask app.
> 1. `app.py`: This file is the entry point of the Flask application and sets up the app with configurations.
